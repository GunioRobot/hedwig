{"content":"<h1>A Brief Touch</h1>\n\n<p>It is very possible to build <em>awesome</em> touch-enabled applications in SproutCore.</p>\n\n<p>But, what makes an awesome touch-enabled application? Sure, it must accept touches,\nbut with SproutCore's (constantly growing) touch support, this is now pretty easy:\nmany existing interfaces, if built with newer SproutCore varieties, will function fine (or mostly fine),\non both larger-screened touch devices (such as iPad) and the traditional desktop environment.</p>\n\n<p>But there are many differences between desktop and touch platforms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Precision.</strong> Touches are less precise than clicks. To compensate, controls should be larger.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance.</strong> Touch-based devices tend to be slow (for now). To get around this just takes \nsome elbow grease: there are many techniques to speed things up... many of which SproutCore will\nhandle for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Animation.</strong> Lack of animation looks okay on desktop (even if animation is cool)... but on\ntouch devices, non-animated interfaces look strange: touch is so much more realistic than mouse,\nbut sudden changes without transitions are not realistic at all.</li>\n<li><strong>Coolness.</strong> Touch-based interfaces are cool. That is all.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this guide, we go over each of these, except for the last, which is rather vague; you'll have to figure out\nyour own meaning of \"coolness\".</p>","errors":[],"demos":{},"articleDirectory":"articles/touch/","outputDirectory":"build/","title":"A Brief Touch","any":"metadata","goes":"Here","damn":"gruber","this":"is still eye-readable","and":"He is wrong about touch apps."}
